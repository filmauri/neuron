# Our first attempt at Machine Learning
Every line of this repo was written by three students of [Istituto Scolastico Don Carlo Gnocchi in Carate Brianza, Italy.](https://www.liceodongnocchi.eu/) 
At our school we learn to code in C++ and this year we are learning Machine Learning and this is our first try at it.   
Hope you like it,
